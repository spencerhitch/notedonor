## What is VexTab?

VexTab is a language that allows you to easily create, edit, and share music notation and guitar tablature. Unlike ASCII tab, which is designed for readability, VexTab is designed for writeability.

Go try it out at [The VexTab Tutorial](http://vexflow.com/vextab/tutorial.html).

If you want to save and share your VexTab, try out [My Vexflow](http://my.vexflow.com).

To see what VexTab can do, take a look at the [list of features](http://my.vexflow.com/articles/53?source=enabled).

## Dependencies

This rewrite of VexTab has three key dependencies:

  * [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - A *nicer* JavaScript.
  * [Jison](http://zaach.github.com/jison/) - An LALR(1) parser modeled on Bison.
  * [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) - A utility-belt library for JavaScript.

For the audio player feature, you need:

  * [MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js) - A soundfont renderer for the web.
  * Soundfonts for various instruments - See MIDI.js for more information.
